# Welcome! 

This repo demonstrates the basic usage of SVG and D3. This is part of the Interactive Frontend Development Module for CodeInstitute.

##### This project has been lightly extended to consolidate code:

- Various SVG and D3 functions have been added to scripts.js
- jQuery has been utilized to call all functions in sequence on document.ready()
