# Welcome! 

This repo demonstrates the basic usage of SVG and D3. This is part of the Interactive Frontend Development Module for CodeInstitute.

##### This project has been lightly extended to consolidate code:

- Various SVG and D3 functions have been added to scripts.js
- jQuery has been utilized to call all functions in sequence on document.ready()
- IMPORTANT: This project uses D3 version 4 which changes some functionality significantly (see https://keithpblog.org/post/upgrading-d3-from-v3-to-v4/)
